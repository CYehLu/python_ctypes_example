# python_ctypes_example

An example of using `ctypes` to call C function in python (or call subroutine/function in Fortran).  
Using `numpy.ctypeslib` to deal with array parameters instead of `ctypes` manner. I think that it is more convenient.  

Only compiled and tested in Linux with GNU compiiler (`gcc` for C and `gfortran` for Fortran).
